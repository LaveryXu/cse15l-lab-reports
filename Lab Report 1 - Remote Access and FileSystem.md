You’ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post about remote access.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into
a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include all the steps you took, along with
screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1,
or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 3 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more 
is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include at least 
2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didn’t do the 
step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the 
department computers worked differently, etc).

# A Tutorial on Remote Access: How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6
## 1. Installing VScode
Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for all the major operating systems, like macOS (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs).

When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this (it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your system and settings):![Image](VSCode.png)

**Write down in notes:** Everyone should share a screenshot of VScode open – help folks figure it out if it won’t install. If someone gets stuck, take a screenshot of the error message or point at which they are stuck so we can help them figure it out later, and they can decide to keep trying (potentially with the tutor helping) or move on.
