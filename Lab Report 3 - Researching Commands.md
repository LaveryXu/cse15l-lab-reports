# Researching Commands
Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose. For example, we saw the -name option for find in class. For each of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.

## `find`
- 4 command-line options：
 1. find -name
   1)e.g.
   2)e.g.
 2. find -type
   1)e.g.
   2)e.g.
 3. find -<>
   1)e.g.
   2)e.g.
 4. find -<>
## `less`
- 4 command-line options：
 1. less <>
   1. e.g.
   2. e.g.
 2. less <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g.
 3. less <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g. 
 4. less <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g. 
## `grep`
- 4 command-line options：
 1. grep <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g.
 2. grep <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g.
 3. grep <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g.
 4. grep <>
    1. e.g.
    2. e.g.

That makes 8 total examples, all focused on a single command. There should be two examples each for four different command-line options. Many commands like these have pretty sophisticated behavior possible – it can take years to be exposed to and learn all of the possible tricks and inner workings.

Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out about it as a URL or a description of where you found it.

To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a built-in command on many systems called man (short for “manual”) that displays information about commands; you can use man grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works. Also consider asking ChatGPT!
