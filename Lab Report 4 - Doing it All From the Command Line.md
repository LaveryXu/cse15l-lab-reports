# Doing it All From the Command Line

For steps 4-9:
1. take a screenshot
2. write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting.
3. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

4. Log into ieng6

  - command I ran: `ssh cs15lsp23he@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
    - keys pressed: ssh`<space>`cs15lsp23he@ieng6.ucsd.edu`<enter>`
    - effect of above keypresses: logs into my ieng6 account
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

  - command I ran: `git clone git@github.com:LaveryXu/lab7.git`
    - keys pressed: git`<space>`clone`<space>`git@github.com:LaveryXu/lab7.git`<enter>`
    - effect of above keypresses: clones my fork of [this repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7.git) from my GitHub account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
  - ![](Run-the-tests-demonstrating-that-they-fail.png)
  - commands I ran: `cd lab7`, `ls`, `bash test.sh`
    - keys pressed: cd`<space>`lab7`<enter>`, ls`<enter>`, bash`<space>`test.sh
    - effect of above keypresses: `cd lab7` changes the working directory to lab7, `ls` lists all unhidden files under the current working directory lab7, and `bash test.sh` runs the tests in ListExamplesTests.java.
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
